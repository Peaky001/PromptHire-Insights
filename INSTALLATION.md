- All profiles: `http://localhost:3000/api/profiles`
- Specific profile: `http://localhost:3000/api/profiles/{id}`
- Health check: `http://localhost:3000/health`

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Loading
- Make sure you selected the `dist` folder, not the project root
- Check Chrome's extension page for any error messages
- Try refreshing the extensions page

### Scraping Not Working
- Ensure you're on a LinkedIn profile page (URL should contain `/in/`)
- Refresh the LinkedIn page and try again
- Check browser console (F12) for any errors

### API Calls Failing
- Verify the API server is running
- Check that the API URL is correct
- Ensure CORS is enabled on your API server (included in example)

## Production Deployment

For production use:
1. Replace the example API server with your production API
2. Update the API URL in the extension
3. Consider implementing authentication/API keys
4. Test thoroughly with different LinkedIn profiles
5. Package the extension for distribution

## Security Notes

- The extension only works on LinkedIn profile pages
- No sensitive data is stored locally
- All API calls go through the background script
- Respect LinkedIn's Terms of Service and rate limits
